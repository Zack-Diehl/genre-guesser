Using Machine Learning Models to Predict the Genre of a Song

We explore the effectiveness and best predictors of several different multi-classification models in predicting the song genre:
1. Logistic Regression
2. AdaBoost
3. Support Vector Machines (Linear SVC)
4. XGBoost

We try three dimensionality reduction techniques to cluster and visualize the data
1. PCA
2. t-SNE
3. UMAP
